# Browser Workshopper

A browser-based [workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper) skeleton.

## Warning

This is a _very_ rough first pass. I basically yanked a bunch of code from [shader-school](https://github.com/gl-modules/shader-school) and hacked it into submission until it finally kinda worked how I wanted. Use at your own risk. Or don't use it at all, because I think [@hughsk](https://github.com/hughsk) is already working on a (probably far superior) version.
