# Browser Workshopper

A browser-based [workshopper](https://github.com/rvagg/workshopper) framework.

## Warning

This is a _very_ rough first pass. I basically yanked a bunch of code from [shader-school](https://github.com/gl-modules/shader-school) and hacked it into submission until it finally kinda worked how I wanted. Then I did a lot more hacking and now it barely resembles the original workshop. But hopefully it will eventually be something other people can use :D

Use at your own risk.

Also, the examples in this repo are woefully outdated, so look at [view-school](https://github.com/lakenen/view-school) as an example for now.
